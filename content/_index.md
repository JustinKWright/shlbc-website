We encourage you to join us for worship or study, fellowship or service, as we welcome the companionship of everyone who longs to follow Jesus and seeks to make sense of his or her experience in the context of a personal relationship with the God who was in Christ.\nWe are a thriving rural church which seeks to provide a compassionate, Christ-like presence in the cities that surround us while being made up of people who live throughout the Collin and Hunt counties. We are Baptist by distinction, mission-minded, service-oriented and inclusive in spirit and practice. Our leadership is filled with strong and thoughtful deacons, elders, teachers and laymen.  These devoted men and women form the backbone of this church and its service to Christ and the world. \nWe believe that worship is the beginning place and perhaps also the ending place of all we do. Worship leads to service and study, fellowship and play, a deeper concern for our neighbors and a yearning to know and learn from those who are different from us.\nWe invite you to join us whenever you can, and we assure you that you will be welcome in this community wherever you are on your journey. We are not perfected saints who have all the answers and no doubts. Rather, we are fellow strugglers on a journey who cherish the companions we have and understand how much our shared life is enriched by every new friend we make. We would be honored to have you join us."
