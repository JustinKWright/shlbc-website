Here at Shepherds Hill Lane Baptist Church, the safety and well being of our children is a top priority. We look forward to teaching your children what it means to walk with Jesus every step of the way and fall more in love with His word. Please join us on Sunday mornings and Wednesday nights as we shine a light on Jesus and build up the future leaders of our church!
