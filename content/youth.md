Our goal is to create an environment for students to develop a Christian community with other believers their age.  We want to help build relationships with adults who will walk with them as they navigate living for Jesus.  We believe that your child was created by God with precision and intentionality.  The purpose is to do more than just get by - God wants them to soar.  Hebrews 6:1 tells us to move beyond basic principles and strive for deeper understanding and spiritual maturity.  Join us as we grow in faith, in purpose and in our community!
