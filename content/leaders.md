# Pastor - Donnie Meeks
On January 8th, 2025, Shepherds Hill Lane Baptist Church welcomed Donnie as the Lead Pastor.

At the age of 5, sitting in the living room with his parents David and Linda Meeks in Garland, Texas, Donnie gave his heart and life to Jesus Christ. The next 8 years of life were marked by growth in discipleship, and at age 13 God called him into Christian ministry. Donnie began preaching and sharing the gospel soon after. While attending the Criswell College in Dallas, he focused his studies on God’s word and began working with teenagers before graduating with a Bachelor of Art in Biblical Studies in 1995.Donnie and Stephanie grew up together in the First Baptist Church of Sachse and were married in May of 2000. They have 6 awesome children: Alexandria, Ashlee, Micah, Miller, Avery and Jeremy. Their story of faith has welcomed them the privilege of proclaiming Jesus in this area for over 25 years together. They have served as youth and worship ministers and have been able to lead many young people to Christ over their time in the Lord’s work. Donnie became a licensed minister in 1993 under his father’s leadership at the FBC of Anna, Texas. He has served in associate pastoral positions that have challenged and shaped him significantly. Most recently, serving as the Associate Pastor here at Shepherds Hill Lane Baptist, he was ordained into the ministry in 2023. Serving the church in these positions has given Donnie a unique perspective into God’s heart for shepherding his church. Donnie received his master’s degree in educational leadership from Dallas Baptist University in 2010. Donnie desires to use the gifts of teaching, leadership, and faith to equip and inspire the church to love God and love others. He believes that now is a critical time in which we must make and mature disciples of Jesus who will change the world.

# Youth - Gary Winkle
Gary is the middle child as well as left handed so he says you might as well call him "Short Straw". Gary and his wife Crystal have made the commitment to provide both a postive impact and to grow our youth group. Their daughter Preslie just recently joined the youth full time. Gary has been on missions trips, including once to Brazil. Gary was also a major league baseball player for two days followed by an injury that caused his dream to come to an abrupt end. Gary always thought that was the plan for his life, but that's the thing... it was his plan. God had a different plan all along and just a few months ago, Gary answered the call to be a part of the ministry. Come and experience the exciting path that we are taking here at Shepherds Hill Lane Baptist Church. We can't wait to see you!
